# Physics - Unit 8

## Primary and secondary sources
- **A primary source** is one that *has not been transformed or converted before use by the consumer*, so a fossil fuel – coal.
- **The definition of a secondary source** of energy is one that results from the transformation of a primary source. Ie. electric energy 
  - Electricity is the most important secondary energy
  - Hydrogen is another useful secondary energy

## Renewable and non renewable sources
- Primary sources can be divided into two, renewable and non-renewable
- Renewable sources: can be replenished in relatively short time
- Non renewable: Finite sources, which are being depleted much faster than they can be produced, and so will run out
- A good way to classify renewable and non-renewable resources is by the rates at which they are being consumed and replaced

## Types of energy sources

- chemical potential, energy stored in the bonds and the energy released during chemical reactions 

## Specific energy and energy density
-  **specific energy:** the number of joules that can be released by each kilogram of the fuel
- **Energy density:** the number of joules that can be released from 1 m3 of a fuel.

**Tip:** You do not need to memorize this 

## Thermal power station
![](https://school.is-inside.me/bBaFV9Uw.png)
- **Internal energy:** the energy associated with the random, disordered motion of molecules (kinetic energy and potential energy of the molecules). 

- Water, is heated (with primary source / chemical energy) to point where there no bubbles during boiling. 
- The steam then spins a turbine which converts the internal energy of the water to kinetic energy
- The blades of the fan spins a coil which produces alternating current (c)

- There are really three energy transfers going on in this process: primary energy to the internal energy of water, this internal energy to the kinetic energy of the turbine, and kinetic energy of the turbine to electrical energy in the generator. 


## Sankey Diagram
- **Sankey Diagram:** A visual representation of energy flow in a system
- There are some rules to remember about the Sankey diagram:
  - Each energy source and loss in the process is represented by an arrow.
  - The diagram is drawn to scale with the width of an arrow being proportional to the amount of energy it represents.
  - The energy flow is drawn from left to right.
  - When energy is lost from the system it moves to the top or bottom of
the diagram.
  - Power transfers as well as energy flows can be represented.
- **Degraded energy:** Energy lost in a process of getting "useful" energy


## Primary sources used in power stations
- **Baseload station:** A station which run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week converting energy all the time. However, the demand that consumers make for energy is variable and cannot always be predicted. From time to time the demand exceeds the output of the baseload stations.
### Fossil fuels
- Advantages:
  - Modern fossil-fuel power stations can be very large and can convert significant amounts of power.
  - Fossil fuels have significant uses in the chemical industry for the production of plastics, medicines, and other important products.
- Disadvantages:
  - The materials have taken a very large time to accumulate and will not be replaced for equally long times.
  - The burning of the fuels releases into the atmosphere large quantities of carbon dioxide that have been locked in the coal, oil, and gas for millions of years. This has a major impact on the response of the atmospheric system to the radiation incident on it from the Sun (the greenhouse and enhanced greenhouse effects).
  - It makes sense to locate power stations as close as possible to places where fossil fuels are recovered; however, this is not always possible and, in some locations, large-scale transportation of the fuels is still required. A need for transport leads to an overall reduction in the efficiency of the process because energy has to be expended in moving the fuels to the power stations.

### Nuclear fuel
- A baseload station
- A particularly common variety of the thermal reactors is the pressurized water reactor (PWR). Uranium-235 is the nuclide used in these reactor
![](https://school.is-inside.me/20tKixlY.png)
- While about 99% of uranium ore is U-238, U-235 is needed in a fission process.
- An initial extraction needs to be done to boost the ratio of U-235
- The fuel needs to contain at least 3% U-235
- Too much U-238 will make the fission process not self-sustaining as it is **a good asorber**
- Fuel with boosted proportions of U-235 is called **enriched**

- The enriched material is then formed into **fuel rods**
- Energy released by the fuel rods are very fast neutrons yet we need neutrons which have similar speed with matter at room temperature 
- Neutrons with speed that neutrons have when equilibrium with matter at around room temperature is called **thermal neutrons**
- The removal of energy is achieved through the use of a **moderator** (because it moderates (slows down) the speeds of the neutrons)
  - Typical moderators for the PWR type include water and carbon in the form of graphite
  - The moderator are inelastic 
  - its function is to receives collision from the neutrons and asorbs the energy from the collision causing the neutron to move slower. It may take multiple collisions to bring the speed of the neutron down to a thermal neutron or ~10 km/s 
- The moderator is not part of the fuel rods but are close together. This is because U-238 is very effective at absorbing high-speed neutrons.
- Criterias for a moderator
  - should not be a good asorber of neutrons (if it does asorb, it will lower the reaction rate or might stop the reaction completely)
  - being inert (does not react with other atoms/molecules) in the extreme conditions of the reactor.
- **control rods:** used to regulate the power output from the reactor and to shut down its operation
  - has to be good at asorbing neutrons (very well)
  - function: to asorb the neutrons in the reaction to stop more fission reacts
- **heat exchanger:** a mechanism used for conveying the internal energy from inside the reactor to the turbines.

#### Safety issues with nuclear power plants
- Safety measures that are needed to be put in place
  - The reactor vessel is made of thick steel to withstand the high temperatures and pressures present in the reactor. This has the benefit of also absorbing alpha and beta radiations together with some of the gamma rays and stray neutron
  - The vessel itself is encased in layers of very thick reinforced concrete that also absorb neutrons and gamma rays.
  - There are emergency safety mechanisms that operate quickly to shut the reactor down in the event of an accident.
  - The fuel rods are inserted into and removed from the core using robots so that human operators do not come into contact with the spent fuel rods, which become highly radioactive during their time in the reactor.
- At the end of the life of a nuclear power plant (20-25 years)
  - reactor plant has to be decommisioned
    - removing all the fuel rods and other high-activity waste products
    - enclosing the reactor vessel and its concrete shield in a larger shell of concrete
  - leave the structure alone for up to a century to allow the activity of the structure to drop to a level similar to that of the local background

### Wind Generators
- A baseload station
- The rotor is rotated by the wind and, through a gearbox, this turns an electrical generator. The electrical energy is fed either to a storage  system (but this increases the expense) or to the electrical grid.
- There are two principle types:
  - horizontal-axis
    - can be steered into the wind
  - veritcal-axis
    - does not have to be steered into the wind and therefore its generator can be placed off-axis.

#### Maximum theoretical value of the available power
- $$\frac{1}{2}\rho\pi r^2v^2$$
- $$\rho$$: density of the air
- A: area of the blade
- v: velocity of the air

- assumes that all kenitic energy from the air can be used 
- While a long blade (large A or r) will give the best energy yields, increasing the radius of the blade also increases its mass and this means that the rotors will not rotate at low wind speeds. 

- Ideal places where wind farms are placed
  - off-shore 
    - wind speeds are higher than over land because the shore tends to be more smooth
  - on top of a hill 
    - due to the shape of the land

| Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| No energy costs                                              | Variable output on a daily or seasonal basis       |
| No chemical pollution                                        | Site availability can be limited in some countries |
| Capital costs can be high but reduce with economies of scale | Noise pollution                                    |
| Easy to maintain on land; not so easy off-shore              | Visual pollution                                   |
|                                                              | Ecological impact                                  |

### Pumped storage
- Not a baseload station, output can be increased or decreased
- There are multiple ways which water can be used as a primary energy source:
  - pumped storage plants (potential)
  - hydroelectric plants (potential)
  - tidal barrage (potential)
  - tidal flow systems (kinetic)
  - wave energy (kinetic)
- All the sources above use one of two methods:
  - The GPE (gravitational potential energy) of water held at a level above a reservoir is converted to electrical energy as the water is allowed to fall to the lower level
  - The kinetic energy of moving water is transferred to electrical energy as the water flows or as waves move
- A pumped storage system (Figure 10) involves the use of two water reservoirs
  - These reservoirs are connected by pipes
  - The ammount of water that can flow through the pipes are dependant on the demand of electricity. if high, more water flows and when low, less water flows.
  - They can go from 0 to 100 output in a few seconds
  - when demand is low, they pump the water back up

#### Maximum theoretical rate of power from water
$$P = \frac{m}{t}g\Delta h = (\frac{V}{t}\rho)g\Delta h$$
- t: time
- m: mass
- V: volume
- $\rho$: density of the water

$$m = \rho * V$$
$$m = \frac{m}{V} * V$$
$$m = m$$

### Solar energy
#### Solar heating panels
![](https://school.is-inside.me/IQO2FtWQ.png)
- solar heating panel contains a pipe, embedded in a black plate, through which a glycol–water mixture is circulated by a pump (glycol has a low freezing point, necessary in cold countries)
- when sunlight, infrared radiation, falls on the blackplate, it heats ups
- the heated gycol is heated through the pipes to the boiler
- through the internal energy, the boiler runs and heats up water
- A solar heating cell absorbs radiant energy and converts it to the internal energy of the working fluid.  

#### Solar photovoltaic panels
- The **photovoltaic cell** consists of a single crystal of semiconductor
that has been doped so that one face is p-type semiconductor and the opposite face is n-type.
  - electrons in n-type, positive “holes”
  - an absence of electrons – in p-type
- The photovoltaic materials in the panel convert electromagnetic radiation from the Sun into electrical energy
- they are used in both series and parralel
- Advantages:
  - low maintenance cost
  - no fuel cost
- disadvantage
  - high initial cost
  - relatively low efficiency

#### Math of Solar energy
$$P = \eta IA$$
- P: Power (W)
- $$\eta$$: efficiency or fraction of the energy arriving that is converted into internal energy
- I: itensity of radiation (from the sun per square meter) (W/m<sup>2</sup>)
- A: area of the solar panel (m<sup>2</sup>)

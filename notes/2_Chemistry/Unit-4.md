## Ionic bonding and structure
- Ionic compounds are formed when electrons are transferred from one atom (metal) to another atom (non-metal) to form positive and negative ions creating electrostatic attraction
- Charges **MUST BE** written as number+ such as "2+"
- Oxidation states are written in +number ie "+2"
- **Positive Ions (Cations)** formed when atoms (usually of metallic elements) lose electron(s). 
- **Negative Ions (Anions)** formed when atoms (usually of non-metallic elements) gain electron(s).
- Ionic bounded compounds are often reffered to salts
- These bonds are stronger than covalent bond
- All elements in main groups (1,2,3, 15, 16, 17) are trying to achieve a stable electronic configuration (noble gas). Thus they lose or gain electrons to create ion which is an **isoelectronic** (same number electrons) as the nearest noble gases
  - Group 1, 2, and 3 will form Cations
  - Group 15, 16, and 17 will form Anions

|Group|1|2|13|15|16|17|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Ion|1+|2+|3+|3-|2-|1-|

**Tip:** rather than memorizing, think of how many electrons need to be removed or added to create the nearest noble gas strucutre

### Transition elements
- They can form more than one stable ion
- The ions can be distinguished by color (flame test)

### Ionic character 
- Predicting an ionic character 
  - Position on the periodic table
  - Electronegativity
- Position on the Periodic table
  - Metals on the left side of the zigzag line tend to lose electrons
  - Non-metals on the right side of the zigzag tend to gain electrons
  - The highest tendency to form ionic compounds will be between elements on the bottom left and the top right
- Electronegativity
  - Differences greater than 1.8 are considered ionic

## Lattice structure
- Every ion is surronded by the opposite charge (only in solid state)
- Ionic compounds have a three-dimensional crystalline structures known as **ionic lattices**
- The strength of force between ions is known as **lattice enthalpy** 
  - The smaller the ion and the greater the charge, the higher the lattice enthalpy
  - The smaller the ion allows stronger forces between the electrons and the nuclei
  - The greater the charge will create larger attraction forces
- The formula unit is the smallest particle of an ionic compound
  - Formula unit is the lowest whole number ratio of ions in an ionic compound

## Physical properties of ionic compounds
- very strong (because oppositely charged) 
- high bp and mp
- solid at room temperature
- low volatility (how easy a substance vaporizes)
  - because ionic compounds have strong electrostatic bonds
- conducts electricity either in molten or water
  - the ions seperate in molten state or in water 
  - Solid ions compounds do not conduct electricity as there is no free moving ions
  - not free moving electron, it is free moving ions
- solubility
  - **solubility:** the ease in which a solid dissolves in a liquid to become a solution. 
  - solubility trends are based on the similarity of the chemical nature of the solute and the solvent
  - Polar compounds dissolve in polar molecules
  - Nonpolar compounds dissolve in nonpolar molecules
  - most ionic substances are soluble in water but some are not
- Brittleness
  - **brittleness:** how easy a crystal will shatter when force is applied
  - Ionic compounds are brittle because ions of like charge can be next to each other in the lattice structure and the repulsive charges causes the structure to split easily

### Naming ionic compounds
- -**ide** means that the element is mono-atomic ion
- -**ite** means that there is oxygen. Either 2 or 3 oxygen
- -**ate** means that there is oxygen. Either 3 or 4 oxygen

### Common polyatomic ions
- **Polyatomic ion:** An ion created by multiple elements which are covalently bonded but has a net charge
|Name|Formula|
|-|-|
|ammonium|NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>|
|hydroxide|OH<sup>-</sup>|
|nitrite|NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>|
|nitrate|NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>|
|hydrogencarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>|
|carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>|
|sulfate|SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>|
|phosphate|PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>|

### Lattice Structures
- **Electrostatic attraction:** positive charges and negative charges attract each other
- The ions take on a predictable 3d crystalline structure known as the **ionic lattice**


## Covalent Compound
- **Covalent Bond:** the electrostatic attraction between the shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms making up the bond.
- **Strength of bond (lowest to highest):**
  - single bond
  - double bond
  - triple bond
- **Length of bond (lowest to highest):**
  - triple bond
  - double bond
  - single bond
- **Coordinate (dative) covalent bond:** A type of covalent bond where *both electrons come from the same atom.*

## Electronegativity
- The measure of the ability/tendecy of an atom to pull the shared paired of electron to itself.
- The pauline scale (chart in data booklet showing electronegative values)
  - Going down a peroid, the lower the electronegativity value is
  - Going right a group, the higher the electronegativity value is
- Polarity:
  - Ie. F<sub>2</sub> is two flourine atoms meaning that the bond stretgh is the same. Thus this molecule is non polar 
- electronegativity **increase across the period** and decreases **down the group**
- Highly electronegative atoms: N Cl O F
- The bond is considered ionic if the **difference** of electronegativity is **1.7+**
  
## Electron deficient
- Has less than 8 electrons in the valance shell
- still stable
- ie. BeCl<sub>2</sub> and BF<sub>3</sub>

## Expanded octet
- in period 3, the d sublevel becomes available, so it is possible to use these orbitals in bonding, resulting in an expanded octet.

## Lewis structure
- A diagram which shows all the valence (outer shell) electrons in a molecule (or ion)
- **Rules:**
  - Center electron is the least electronegative
  - Each atom should have 8 electrons in its outer shell (except hydrogen which has 2). This is done by using single bonds, double bonds, triple bonds and + or - charges.
  - If the central atom is from period 2, it should have no more than eight electrons in its outer shell. It should generally (but not always) have noble gas electron configuration.
  - If the central atom is from period 3, it may have up to 18 electrons in its outer shell.
  - Dative bonds are shown with an arrow pointing to which atom which the electrons originated from

### Resonance structure
- A set of two or more Lewis Structures that collectively describe the bonding of a single polyatomic molecule.
- More than one way to draw a molecule's lewis structure

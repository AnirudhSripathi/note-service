# Physics - Unit 3
- Heat is energy that is transferred from one body to another as a result of a difference in temperature.
- Internal energy is the total random kinetic energy of the particles of a substance, plus the total inter-particle potential energy of the particles.
-  The internal energy of a system can change as a result of heat added or taken out and as a result of work performed.

## Specific heat capacity
**Definition:** the required amount of energy to increase the temperature of a unit mass (1kg) by one kelvin (1K)

$\ Q = mcΔT$
- Q: Heat required ( $\ J$ )
- m: mass ( $\ kg$ )
- c: specific heat capacity ( $\ J kg^{-1} K^{-1}$ )
- ΔT: difference in temperature ( $\ K$ )

## Change of phase

## Specific latent heat
- the amount of energy required to change the phase of a unit mass at constant temperature

$\ Q = mL$
- Q: Heat required ( $\ J$ )
- m: mass ( $\ kg$ )
- L: specific latent heat ( $\ J kg^{-1}$ )

## Boltzmann equation

$\ \frac{1}{2} mc^{2} = \frac{3}{2} k_b T$
- m: mass
- c: rms (root mean square) speed
- k<sub>b</sub>: blotzmann constant (1.38 * 10<sup>-23</sup>)
- T: temperature

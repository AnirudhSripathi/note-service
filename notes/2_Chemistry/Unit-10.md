# Organic Chemistry
- The study of carbon, the compounds it makes, and the reactions it makes
- Homologous series, the families in which we classify organic compounds
  - They have the same functional groups (a group of atoms found within a molecule that are involved in the chemical reactions characteristics of those molecules)
  - They have the same general formula
  - They have similar chemical property but slightly varying physical properties
  - Members differ by a CH<sub>2<sub> group

  - Alkanes, single bond from C-C
  - Alkenes, double bond from C-C
  - Alkynes
  - Alchohol, OH bond at the end
  - carbocylic acid, COOH (caboxyl)
  - Esters, ester linkage COO group
  - aldehyde, -CHO
  - ketones, - CO

| Electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions | Electrostatic attraction between a shared paired of electrons  |

| Soluble in water                                         | Insoluble in water                                             |
| Conduct electricity when molten due to free moving ions  | Does not conduct electricity because there are no ions present |

## Ionic bonding and structure
- Ionic compounds are formed when electrons are transferred from one atom (metal) to another atom (non-metal) to form positive and negative ions creating electrostatic attraction
- Ionic bounded compounds are often reffered to salts
- These bonds are stronger than covalent bond
- All elements in main groups (1,2,3, 15, 16, 17) are trying to achieve a stable electronic configuration (noble gas). Thus they lose or gain electrons to create ion which is an **isoelectronic** (same number electrons) as the nearest noble gases
- **Physical properties of ionic compounds**
  - very strong (because oppositely charged) 
  - high bp and mp
  - solid at room temperature
  - not volatile
  - conducts electricity either in molten or water
    - the ions seperate in water (non polar solubles)
    - not free moving electron, it is free moving ions
  - solubility in water
    - most ionic substances are soluble but some are not
    
### Common polyatomic ions / compound ions
| Name              | Formula                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| ammonium          | NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>  |
| hydroxide         | OH<sup>-</sup>              |
| nitrate           | NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>  |
| hydrogencarbonate | HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> |
| carbonate         | CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> |
| sulfate           | SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> |
| phosphate         | PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> |

### Lattice Structures
- **Electrostatic attraction:** positive charges and negative charges attract each other
- The ions take on a predictable 3d crystalline structure known as the **ionic lattice**

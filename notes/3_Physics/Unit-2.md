# Physics - Unit 2

## 2.1 Motion
* **Distance (d, m):** A *scalar* quantity measuring how far two locations are on a certain path.
* **Displacement (s, m):** A *vector* quantity defined by the length and direction of the line segment joining the initial and final position.
* **Speedy (s, m/s):** rate of change of *distance* over time
* **Velocity (v, m/s):** rate of change of *displacement* over time
* **Acceleration (a, m/s<sup>2</sup>):** change in *velocity* per unit of time

| acceleration (a) |              |

### Non accelerated motion (d. s, t)
$\ d = s \cdot t$
- d = distance (m)
- s = speed (m/s)
- t = time (s)

### Accelerated motion (Equations of motion for uniform acceleration)
$\ a = \frac{v-u}{t}$
$\ s = u \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot t^2$
$\ v^2 = u^2 + 2as$
$\ s = \frac{t(v + u)}{2}$
 
- s = displacement (m)
- u = initial velocity (m/s)
- v = final velocity (m/s)
- a = acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>)
- t = time (s)

### Average speed (v)
$\ v = \frac{total\ distance\ travelled}{total\ time}$

### Graphs
- Displacement (m) / time (s) graph
  - slope: velocity
  - area: nothing
- Velocity (m/s) / time (s) graph
  - slope: acceleration
  - area: displacement
- Acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>)/ time (s) graph
  - Area under/above the line shows change in velocity
  - Horizontal lines imply constant acceleration (not constantly velocity)

## Projectile Motion
- An object is said to undergo projectile motion when it follows a **curved** path **due to the influence of gravity.**

## 2.2 Forces

## Friction
μ = $\frac{f}{N}$
* μ = coefficient of friction
* f = friction force
* N = normal force


$\\f=μ*N$

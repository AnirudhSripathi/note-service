## Ionic bonding and structure
- Ionic compounds are formed when electrons are transferred from one atom (metal) to another atom (non-metal) to form positive and negative ions creating electrostatic attraction
- Charges **MUST BE** written as number+ such as "2+"
- Oxidation states are written in +number ie "+2"
- **Positive Ions (Cations)** formed when atoms (usually of metallic elements) lose electron(s). 
- **Negative Ions (Anions)** formed when atoms (usually of non-metallic elements) gain electron(s).
- Ionic compounds are often referred to salts
- These bonds are stronger than covalent bond
- All elements in main groups (1, 2, 13, 15, 16, 17) are trying to achieve a stable electronic configuration (noble gas). Thus they lose or gain electrons to create ion which is an **isoelectronic** (same number electrons) as the nearest noble gases
  - Group 1, 2, and 13 will form Cations
  - Group 15, 16, and 17 will form Anions

| Group | 1   | 2   | 13  | 15  | 16  | 17  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ion   | 1+  | 2+  | 3+  | 3-  | 2-  | 1-  |

**Tip:** rather than memorizing, think of how many electrons need to be removed or added to create the nearest noble gas structure

### Transition elements
- They can form more than one stable ion
- The ions can be distinguished by color (flame test)

### Ionic Character 
- Predicting an ionic character 
  - Position on the periodic table
  - Electronegativity
- Position on the Periodic table
  - Metals on the left side of the zigzag line tend to lose electrons
  - Non-metals on the right side of the zigzag tend to gain electrons
  - The highest tendency to form ionic compounds will be between elements on the bottom left and the top right
- Electronegativity
  - Differences greater than 1.8 are considered ionic

## Lattice structure
- Every ion is surronded by the opposite charge (only in solid state)
- Ionic compounds have a three-dimensional crystalline structures known as **ionic lattices**
- The strength of force between ions is known as **lattice enthalpy** 
  - The smaller the ion and the greater the charge, the higher the lattice enthalpy
  - The smaller the cation and anions allows stronger electrostatic forces between the ions
  - The greater the charge will create larger attraction forces
- The formula unit is the smallest particle of an ionic compound
  - **Formula unit** is the lowest whole number ratio of ions in an ionic compound

## Physical properties of ionic compounds
- very strong (because oppositely charged) 
- high bp and mp
- solid at room temperature
- low volatility (how easy a substance vaporizes)
  - because ionic compounds have strong electrostatic bonds
- conducts electricity either in molten or water
  - the ions seperate in molten state or in water 
  - Solid ions compounds do not conduct electricity as there is no free moving ions
  - not free moving electron, it is free moving ions
- solubility
  - **solubility:** the ease in which a solid dissolves in a liquid to become a solution. 
  - solubility trends are based on the similarity of the chemical nature of the solute and the solvent
  - Polar compounds dissolve in polar molecules
  - Nonpolar compounds dissolve in nonpolar molecules
  - most ionic substances are soluble in water but some are not
- Brittleness
  - **brittleness:** how easy a crystal will shatter when force is applied
  - Ionic compounds are brittle because when a force is applied, layers of ions can shift causing the repulsive forces causes the structure to split easily

### Naming ionic compounds
- -**ide** means that the element is monatomic ion
- -**ite** means that there is oxygen. Either 2 or 3 oxygen
- -**ate** means that there is oxygen. Either 3 or 4 oxygen

## Electronegativity
- The measure of the ability/tendecy of an atom to pull the shared paired of electron to itself.
- The pauling scale (chart in data booklet showing electronegative values)
  - Going down a group, the lower the electronegativity value is
  - Going right a period, the higher the electronegativity value is
- Polarity:
  - Ie. F<sub>2</sub> is two flourine atoms meaning that the bond strength is the same. Thus this molecule is non polar 
- electronegativity **increase across the period** and decreases **down the group**
- Highly electronegative atoms: N O F
- The bond is considered ionic if the **difference** of electronegativity is **1.8+**
  

### Common polyatomic ions
- **Polyatomic ion:** An ion created by multiple elements which are covalently bonded but has a net charge
| Name               | Formula                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| ammonium           | NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>  |
| hydroxide          | OH<sup>-</sup>              |
| nitrite            | NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>  |
| nitrate            | NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>  |
| hydrogen carbonate | HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> |
| carbonate          | CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> |
| sulfate            | SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> |
| phosphate          | PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> |

### Lattice Structures
- **Electrostatic attraction:** positive charges and negative charges attract each other
- The ions take on a predictable 3d crystalline structure known as the **ionic lattice**


## Covalent Compound
- **Covalent Bond:** the electrostatic attraction between the shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms making up the bond.
- **Strength of bond (lowest to highest):**
  - single bond
  - double bond
  - triple bond
- **Length of bond (lowest to highest):**
  - triple bond
  - double bond
  - single bond  
- The bond is stronger and short with more bonds because more shared of electrons create stronger electrostatic forces of attraction between the nuclei and the shared paired of electrons.
- **Octet Rule:** The tendency to form a stable arragement of 8 electrons in the outer shell

### Covalent Character
- Predicting an covalent compound
  - Position on the periodic table
    - Covalent compounds tend to form between 2 non metals 
    - The closer the elements the more covalent it is
  - Electronegativity differences
    - Electronegativity is the difference of the electronegative values between the two elements
    - Electronegativity must be lower than 1.8
    - the closer the electronegativity is to 0, the more covalent the molecule is
- Covalent compounds which consists of the 2 atoms of same element is called **diatomic molecules**
- **Coordinate (dative) covalent bond:** A type of covalent bond where *both electrons come from the same atom.*

### Bond polarity
- A bond is polar if the bond is unsymmetrical in terms of electron distribution
- **Dipole:** the bond has an area of positive charge and an area of negative charge ($\delta$)
- The pauling scale predicts the polarity by using electronegativity differences
  - Values between 0.0 - 0.4 are considered non-polar covalent
  - Values between 0.4 - 1.8 are considered to be polar covalent.
  - Values greater than 1.8 are considered ionic
  - The greater the difference, the more polar the molecule
  - A vector can be drawn to show the electronegativity. 
    - The vector must be from the slightly positive (+) to the slightly negative (-) side

### Octet rule exception
#### Electron deficient
- Has less than 8 electrons in the valance shell
- still stable
- ie. BeCl<sub>2</sub> and BF<sub>3</sub>

## Expanded octet
- in period 3, the d sublevel becomes available, so it is possible to use these orbitals in bonding, resulting in an expanded octet.

## Lewis structure
- A diagram which shows all the valence (outer shell) electrons in a molecule (or ion)
- **Rules:**
  - Each atom should have 8 electrons in its outer shell (except hydrogen which has 2). This is done by using single bonds, double bonds, triple bonds and + or - charges.
  - If the central atom is from period 2, it should have no more than eight electrons in its outer shell. It should generally (but not always) have noble gas electron configuration.
  - If the central atom is from period 3, it may have up to 18 electrons in its outer shell.
  - Dative bonds are shown with an arrow pointing from the original atom which the electron pair came from to the atom which it shared to

### Resonance structure
- A set of two or more Lewis Structures that collectively describe the bonding of a single polyatomic molecule.
- More than one way to draw a molecule's lewis structure
![Example of CO3](https://school.is-inside.me/LajkW3Ap.png)

## Molecular Polarity
- The polarity of a molecule depends on:
  - The polar bonds the molecule contains
  - The shape of the molecule
- If the bonds are equally polar and arranged symmetrically, then dipole moments cancel each other out are non polar

## VSEPR Theory
- Valance Shell Electron Pair Repulsion
- in a small molecule, the lone pairs and bonding pairs are arranged as far apart from each other as possible in terms of avaliable space. THis is because repulsive forces between like negative charges (electrons) 
- The pair of electrons may be either non bonding pair (lone pair) or bonding pairs (pairs of electron involved in a covalent bond)
- Non bonding pair is a lone pair. They do not have any bonds
- Maximum Replusion
  - Where we have maximum replusion is between 2 lone pairs. Because their electron cloud is larger.
  - The second strongest is lone and bonding pair
  - The weakest is between 2 bonding pairs

## Electron domains
- All types of bonds (single, double and triple) bonded electrons are orientated together and behave as a single unit known as an electron domain
- Lone pairs also count as electron domains

## Electron and Molecular Geometry
- **Electron Geometry:** The shape of the arragement of the electron domains based on the amount of electron domains (this includes both bonding electron domain pairs and lone pairs)
- **Molecular Geometry:** The shape of the molecule based on only the amount of bonding pair 
- **N.E.D.** Number of electron domains
| N.E.D. | Number of electron pairs      | Electron Geometry    | Molecular Geomtry    | Bond Angles      | Example         |

- Allotropes can vary in physical and chemical properties
- Examples of carbon allotropes:
  - diamond
  - graphite 
  - graphene
  - fullerene
- carbon and silicon from giant covalent/network covalent structures
- graphite, diamond, and graphene are examples of covalent network solid
- quartz is a covalent network solid formed from silicon dioxide

- high melting point

## Intermolecular forces
- **Intermolecular forces:** forces between molecules
- **Intramolecular forces:** forces within the molecule such as covalent, ionic and metallic bonding
- The strength of the intermolecular forces determine the volatility of a substance
- The stronger the forces, the stronger the melting and boiling point
- Intermolecular forces includes:
  - Hydrogen bonding
  - London dispersion forces 
  - permanent dipole-dipole forces 

### London forces
- The weakest intermolecular force
- result of temporary dipole induced dipole dipole interactions
- larger the atom / atomic radius / more electrons, the stronger the London dispersion forces as there are is a larger probability of temporary dipoles forming

### Permanent dipole dipole interactions
- Stronger than london dispersion forces
- Strength of the dipole depends on the polarity
- They are caused when molecules with a positive and negative area, attract each other
- The stronger the dipole attraction, the higher the boiling point
- a result of electronegativity in the electron cloud towards 1 atom.
- only happens to polar molecules

### Hydrogen bonding
- The strongest of the intermolecular forces
- A type of dipole-dipole attraction 
- involves hydrogen bonding with either F O or N as they are the most electronegative
- The strength of the hydrogen bond is due to the small size of hydrogen and the large electronegativity of N, O, and F.
- Positive hydrogen bonds with lone pairs of electron on nitrogen, oxygen, and flourine.
- requirements:
  - molecule needs hydrogen
  - there must be one of the most electronegative atoms (F O or N)
  - the electronegative atom atom needs to have at least one lone pair 
- it is responsible for ice floating on water

## Van der Waal's forces
- Includes London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces and dipole-induced dipole forces.
- it refers to all forces between molecules that do not involve electrostatic attractions (intramolecular forces) between ions and bonds formation.

### Overall forces
```
London < permanent dipole dipole moment < hydrogen bonding
Weakest ----------------------------------------> Strongest
```

## Predicting the Physical Properties of Covalent compounds
### Volatility
- The weaker the intermolecular force, the higher the volatility

```
Ionic and giant covalent < polar covalent < non polar covalent
Lowest volatility ------------------------> Highest volatility
```

### Electrical Conductivity
- Covalent compounds do not contain delocalized electrons meaning that they do not conduct electricity in solid or liquid state
- Some polar covalent compounds, such as HCL which can ionize in water, will conduct electricity
- Ionic compounds conduct electricity in molten or aqueous state
- Giant covalent structures are generally non-conductors except for graphite, graphene, fullerene, Si

### Solubility
- Like dissolves in like
  - Non polar compounds dissolve in non polar solvents
  - Polar compounds dissolve in polar solvents
- Solubility is reduced in larger molecules where the polar bond is only part of the total structure
- Ionic compounds are soluble in water (polar) but non-soluble in non polar solvents
- Giant covalent structures are non soluble in polar and non polar solvents due to the very strong covalent bond within their structure

### Boiling and melting point
- The stronger the force, the higher the boiling and melting point
- ```
  London < permanent dipole dipole moment < hydrogen bonding
  Weakest ---------------------------------------> Strongest
  ```

## Metalic bonding
- A bond which exists within the metal itself
- Metallic bonding occurs when the delocalized electrons in metal atoms are attracted to a lattice of positive metal ions
- electrostatic force of attraction between a lattice of cations and delocalized electrons where the electrons are free to move throughout the metal
- metalic bonds are strong bonds
- factors which affect bond strength and mp bp
  - ion charge (higher charge, stronger bond)
  - the number of delocalized electrons (the number of electrons in the outer shell, greater the number, stronger the bond)
  - the size of the ion (smaller the ion the greater the attraction strength)


### Properties of metals
- Good conductor of electricity due to the delocalized electrons are highly mobile and move through the metal structure
- Good conductor of heat due to the same electron mobility
- Metals are maleable and ductile because the non directional nature of the bond
- Metals have high melting points becauses lots of energy is required to break the strong metallic bonds
- Metals are shiny and lustrous because the delocalized electrons in the metallic structure reflects light

## Alloys
- Most metals are not used in their pure forms
  - they are relatively soft.
- A homogeneous mixture of a metal and another element (does not have to be a metal)
- Those metals are mixed in molten state
- When they solidify, ions of different metals are scattared throughout the lattice and are bound by the delocalized electrons
- Alloys are possible because of the non directional nature of the delocalized electrons and the fact that the lattice (the sturcture of the cations) can accomodate ions of different sizes
- Alloys has properties which are distinctly different from their component elements 
  - this is because the different packing of the cations in the lattice
  - Some alloys are stronger due to the size of the atoms are different thus the ions cannot slide over each other making it stronger
  - some properties of an alloy is not always desirable
  - The alloy is often more chemically stable, stronger, resistant to corrosion depending on the component metals.
- Trends are limited to "s" and "p" block elements only

### Common Alloys
- Steel — iron with carbon and other elements
  - High tensile strength but tends to corrode
- Stainless steel — iron with nickel or chromium
  - High strength and corrosion resitant
- Brass — copper and zinc
  - Plumbing
- Bronze — copper and tin
  - Coins and tools

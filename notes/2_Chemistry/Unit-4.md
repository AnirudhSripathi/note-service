## Ionic bonding and structure
- Ionic compounds are formed when electrons are transferred from one atom (metal) to another atom (non-metal) to form positive and negative ions creating electrostatic attraction
- **Positive Ions (Cations)** formed when atoms (usually of metallic elements) lose electron(s). 
- **Negative Ions (Anions)** formed when atoms (usually of non-metallic elements) gain electron(s).
- Ionic bounded compounds are often reffered to salts
- These bonds are stronger than covalent bond
- All elements in main groups (1,2,3, 15, 16, 17) are trying to achieve a stable electronic configuration (noble gas). Thus they lose or gain electrons to create ion which is an **isoelectronic** (same number electrons) as the nearest noble gases
- **Physical properties of ionic compounds**
  - very strong (because oppositely charged) 
  - high bp and mp
  - solid at room temperature
  - not volatile
  - conducts electricity either in molten or water
    - the ions seperate in water (non polar solubles)
    - not free moving electron, it is free moving ions
  - solubility in water
    - most ionic substances are soluble but some are not

| Group | 1   | 2   | 13  | 15  | 16  | 17  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ion   | 1+  | 2+  | 3+  | 3-  | 2-  | 1-  |
**Tip:** rather than memorizing, think of how many electrons need to be removed or added to create the nearest noble gas strucutre

### Common ionic compound names
| Name              | Formula                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| ammonium          | NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>  |
| hydroxide         | OH<sup>-</sup>              |
| nitrate           | NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>  |
| hydrogencarbonate | HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> |
| carbonate         | CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> |
| sulfate           | SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> |
| phosphate         | PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> |

### Lattice Structures
- **Electrostatic attraction:** positive charges and negative charges attract each other
- The ions take on a predictable 3d crystalline structure known as the **ionic lattice**


## Covalent Compound
- **Covalent Bond:** the electrostatic attraction between the shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms making up the bond.
- **Strength of bond (lowest to highest):**
  - single bond
  - double bond
  - triple bond
- **Length of bond (lowest to highest):**
  - triple bond
  - double bond
  - single bond
- **Coordinate (dative) covalent bond:** A type of covalent bond where *both electrons come from the same atom.*

## Electronegativity
- The measure of the ability/tendecy of an atom to pull the shared paired of electron to itself.
- The pauline scale (chart in data booklet showing electronegative values)
  - Going down a peroid, the lower the electronegativity value is
  - Going right a group, the higher the electronegativity value is
- Polarity:
  - Ie. F<sub>2</sub> is two flourine atoms meaning that the bond stretgh is the same. Thus this molecule is non polar 
- electronegativity **increase across the period** and decreases **down the group**
- Highly electronegative atoms: N Cl O F
- The bond is considered ionic if the **difference** of electronegativity is **1.7+**
  
## Electron deficient
- Has less than 8 electrons in the valance shell
- still stable
- ie. BeCl<sub>2</sub> and BF<sub>3</sub>

## Expanded octet
- in period 3, the d sublevel becomes available, so it is possible to use these orbitals in bonding, resulting in an expanded octet.

## Lewis structure
- A diagram which shows all the valence (outer shell) electrons in a molecule (or ion)
- **Rules:**
  - Center electron is the least electronegative
  - Each atom should have 8 electrons in its outer shell (except hydrogen which has 2). This is done by using single bonds, double bonds, triple bonds and + or - charges.
  - If the central atom is from period 2, it should have no more than eight electrons in its outer shell. It should generally (but not always) have noble gas electron configuration.
  - If the central atom is from period 3, it may have up to 18 electrons in its outer shell.
  - Dative bonds are shown with an arrow pointing to which atom which the electrons originated from

### Resonance structure
- A set of two or more Lewis Structures that collectively describe the bonding of a single polyatomic molecule.
- More than one way to draw a molecule's lewis structure
